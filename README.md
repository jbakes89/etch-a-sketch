# Etch-a-Sketch

## for The Odin Project

---

This was completed as part of the Odin Project Foundations course as an exercise in basic programming principles using JavaScript.

### Things I've learned/practised:
- Using document fragments
- Adding and removing elements from the DOM

### Things to add/improve:

### TODO (updated 3rd May 2021)
- Implement draw modes (e.g., single colour, random colours, incremental opacity, smooth colour transitions, etc.)
    1. Colour select for single colour mode (dropdown menu on hover?)
    2. Implement mode selection in Painter class (do this by subclassing Painter?)
- Have options menu only show when mousing over tab/menu?
- Export function allowing images to be saved?
- Sharing function for SNS integration (this is beyond the scope of this project, but something to consider adding in the future)
