# Etch-a-Sketch

## for The Odin Project

---

This was completed as part of the Odin Project Foundations course as an exercise in basic programming principles using JavaScript.

### Things I've learned/practised:
- Using document fragments
- Adding and removing elements from the DOM

### Things to add/improve:

### TODO (updated 30th April 2021)
- Build options menu (grid size, erase button, draw modes [single colour, random colors, incremental opacity, smooth color transitions, etc.])
- Have options menu only show when mousing over tab/menu
