# Etch-a-Sketch

## for The Odin Project

---

This was completed as part of the Odin Project Foundations course as an exercise in basic programming principles using JavaScript.

### Things I've learned/practised:
- Using document fragments
- Adding and removing elements from the DOM

### Things to add/improve:

### TODO (updated 11th May 2021)
- Rearrange options menu e.g., \[Grid Size | Painting Mode | Erase All | Additional Options\], where "Additional Options" changes depending on "Painting Mode" (e.g., Color Select | Variable Alpha | Alpha Increment, etc.) Export/Import/Sharing/etc. could be added to options menu later.
- Have options menu only show when mousing over tab/menu? Or option to hide/show menu?
- Export function allowing images to be saved?
- Sharing function for SNS integration (this is beyond the scope of this project, but something to consider adding in the future)
